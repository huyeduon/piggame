        On your turn, you roll a single six-sided die and add the number rolled
        to your turn total. After each roll, you have two choices: Continue
        rolling the die to accumulate more points for your turn total. Choose to
        "Hold," which means your turn total is added to your overall score, and
        your turn ends. There is a risk involved in continuing to roll. If you
        roll a 1, your turn total is reset to zero, and your turn immediately
        ends, forfeiting any points you might have accumulated in that turn. The
        next player then takes their turn. The first player to reach or exceed
        100 points in their overall score wins the game.
